# ðŸš€ Automated Result Fetching Process ðŸš€

This project automates the process of fetching and saving student results from a university website. The automation handles CAPTCHA solving, dynamic form submissions, and data extraction for multiple students efficiently.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Highlights

- **Selenium WebDriver**: Automated the navigation of a complex web interface, handling dynamic content selection and form submission programmatically.
- **Captcha Recognition**: Solved CAPTCHA challenges using Pythonâ€™s Tesseract OCR (`pytesseract`), converting image-based CAPTCHAs into readable text for smooth form submissions.
- **Retry Logic**: A robust retry mechanism was implemented, retrying up to 10 times to handle failures in CAPTCHA recognition.
- **Data Scraping**: Extracted essential fields such as student name, enrollment number, SGPA, CGPA, and result status from the dynamically generated result page.
- **Data Storage**: Scraped data is efficiently written to a structured CSV file using Pythonâ€™s `csv` module, making it easy to analyze and store results across a range of enrollment numbers.
- **Session Handling**: Implemented session reinitialization to handle multiple iterations without encountering stale element exceptions, ensuring smooth scraping.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python Selenium**: For browser automation and dynamic form submission.
- **Tesseract OCR**: To decode image-based CAPTCHA.
- **OpenCV & Requests**: For retrieving and preprocessing CAPTCHA images from the web.
- **CSV Module**: For efficient data storage and future scalability.

## ðŸ”Ž Why This Matters

- **Efficiency Boost**: Automation of repetitive tasks saves time and increases productivity.
- **Accuracy**: Reduces human error, especially in CAPTCHA solving and data entry.
- **Scalability**: The solution can be extended to retrieve bulk data with minimal changes.
